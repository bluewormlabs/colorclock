Color Clock
===========

About
-----
We're fans of [The Colour Clock][TCC]. Unfortunately, it's written in Flash 
and run by small screensaver wrappers. This leads to bugs (particularly with 
multiple displays) and performance issues.

Being software developers, we decided to just write our own.

Windows
-------
There are currently no binaries available.

The source code (under the `win` directory) should build and run on any 
Windows sytem with .NET 2.0 or newer. Note that he project and solution files 
are in Visual Studio 2010 format.

After building the project, copy the resulting `.exe` to your System32 folder
and rename it; the extension must be `.scr`. You should now be able to select
the screensaver.

Mac

Coming soon!
